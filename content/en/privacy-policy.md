## 5. Transfers of personal data and processing tools

Personal data are processed by automated means for the time strictly necessary to achieve the purposes for which they were collected. Specific security measures are observed to prevent data loss, illicit or incorrect use and unauthorised access.

Processing related to the services of this website is carried out at the headquarters of the Company that owns the servers in the name and on behalf of the Data Controller Company and is handled only by employees, authorised collaborators, as well as any persons in charge of occasional maintenance operations. In addition to the Data Controller, in some cases, other parties involved in the organisation of this Website or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, hosting providers, IT companies, communication agencies) may have access to the Data.

The updated list of these subjects can always be requested from the Data Controller.

As part of some processing operations carried out through the website, the Data Controller relies on providers to supply certain services that involve the transfer of personal data to the United States.

In particular, the following cases can be referred to:

-  Tracking services for marketing purposes and user profiling carried out through the tools offered by Google, Telegram and Sendgrid
-  Identity verification service for users who intend to make a token purchase. This service is provided by Passbase.

The transfer of personal data to the United States is no longer permitted following the application of the principles dictated in the CJEU's Schrems II ruling. Such transfers are considered illegitimate and insecure because the United States does not provide adequate protection and safeguards for citizens' personal data with risks of access to personal data by third parties such as government agencies and intelligence services without adequate legal basis.

In accordance with the principle of transparency and fairness, the Data Controller uses such tools as necessary for the performance of its activities and informs users of the potential risks associated with the processing of personal data.

In any case, such transfers are made only following the explicit and free consent given by the user, who is informed of the risks associated with such transfers.
