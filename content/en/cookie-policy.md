## About Cookies

Cookies are small blocks of data created by a web server placed on a user's device during web browsing. This site uses cookies to improve your browsing experience, remember your settings, and for marketing purposes.

The Data Controller uses services that involve the transfer of personal data to the United States. Such transfers are considered illegitimate and unsafe because the United States does not provide adequate protection and safeguards to citizens' personal data with risks of access to personal data by third parties such as government agencies and intelligence services without adequate legal basis. You can freely consent to such transfers and only upon your consent will the transfer be implemented
