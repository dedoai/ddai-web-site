AI's ability to generate content raises concerns about unauthorized use of copyrighted materials. For example, if an AI model is trained on copyrighted works, it might inadvertently reproduce or imitate elements from these works in the content it generates.

This situation creates potential for copyright infringement, even if the AI operates without human intent to violate copyright. The complexity increases when AI uses large datasets of copyrighted materials to "learn," as it is not always clear whether such use requires permission or if exceptions like fair use apply.
