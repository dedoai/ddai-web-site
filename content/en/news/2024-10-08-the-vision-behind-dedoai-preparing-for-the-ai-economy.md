Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries at an unprecedented pace. While AI is becoming smarter, it heavily relies on quality data to learn and improve. But in this evolving landscape, who owns the data?

At dedoAI, we believe that data producers (you!) should have ownership over your data. Our vision is to empower data creators with monetization opportunities and ensure that individuals and businesses are rewarded for their contributions. By doing so, we prepare everyone for the upcoming AI-driven economic changes, where data will be the currency of the future.

With dedoAI, you can:
- Take ownership of your data
- Monetize your valuable data assets
- Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA
