• How it works:
Producers stake their dedoAI tokens, and the more data they provide, the higher their rewards. The reward percentage is directly linked to the amount and value of the data a producer contributes. This way, active participants are incentivized to continuously provide high-quality data.

• Why it matters:
Our staking model ensures that those who contribute the most to the ecosystem benefit the most, creating a sustainable and fair system for all participants. The Proof of Data mechanism aligns the interests of the entire community, encouraging both data creation and ethical participation.
