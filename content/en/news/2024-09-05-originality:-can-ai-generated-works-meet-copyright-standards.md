For a work to qualify for copyright protection, it must be original, reflecting a certain level of creativity rather than merely replicating existing works. This standard is complicated by AI, which often generates content by processing vast amounts of pre-existing data.
If an AI creates a work by synthesizing or recombining elements from existing materials, can the resulting work truly be considered original? Moreover, since AI "creates" by analyzing and reorganizing data rather than engaging in human-like creative thinking, questions arise about whether AI-generated content can satisfy the originality requirement for copyright protection.
