Traditionally, copyright law has recognized authorship as belonging to the human creator of a work. However, AI blurs the lines of this concept. When AI generates a piece of art, text, or music, the question arises: who is the true author?

Some argue that the programmers behind the AI should be considered the authors since they designed the tool that produced the work. Others believe that the user who directs the AI's actions should be credited, as they initiate the creative process. Yet, in many instances, the AI's role is so autonomous that neither the programmer nor the user can be easily identified as the "creator." This lack of clarity creates a legal gray area, where current copyright laws struggle to provide definitive answers.
