At the heart of dedoAI’s marketplace is our Data Contest system. This innovative feature allows data consumers to request specific types of data through a Call for Data (C4D) proposal, and data producers can compete to fulfill these requests.

How the Data Contest works:
1. A consumer (buyer) submits a C4D, specifying the data type, size, format, and source they need.
2. Producers (sellers) then participate in a competitive bidding process, where they submit their offers for the requested data.
3. The consumer reviews and selects the best offer based on price, data quality, and relevance.
4. Once accepted, the data transaction is completed through the dedoAI wallet, with all processes secured by smart contracts.

This competitive system ensures fair pricing, high-quality data, and maximum transparency for both buyers and sellers. It’s a win-win!
