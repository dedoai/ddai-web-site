  title: Blockchain Archiving
  text: The blockchain acts as an unchangeable archive for all transactions, ensuring data transparency and integrity. Each dataset is identified by a unique checksum, a digital fingerprint that guarantees its uniqueness. By storing these checksums on the blockchain, we create a permanent and tamper-proof record of each transaction, preventing fraud and manipulation.
