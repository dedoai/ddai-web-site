  title: Copyright Guarantee
  text: When a Producer sells their datasets, a copyright transfer agreement is signed, granting Consumers the copyright of the purchased datasets. These contracts, supported by transactions in DedoAI Tokens, ensure a clear and traceable transfer of rights. The copyright transfer process is fundamental in protecting both Producers and Consumers, ensuring that data is used in accordance with the established terms.

  title: Blockchain Archiving
  text: The DedoAI blockchain serves as an immutable archive for all transactions, guaranteeing data transparency and integrity. Each dataset produced by Producers is uniquely identified by a checksum, a digital fingerprint of the file that ensures the data's uniqueness and integrity. By saving these checksums on the blockchain, a permanent and unalterable trace of each transaction is created, making any manipulation or fraud impossible. This system not only protects Consumers' rights but also provides a reliable and verifiable certification of transactions.
